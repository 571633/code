Contribution: 
This paper presents a new model to calculate. 
Also it proposes a prototype tool which can .

An empirical analyzes has been applied into the projects to compare the results of the model with Reuse Percent. 
The results show that the model has better indication of the improvement of software quality and productivity rather than Reuse Percent which I think can be very useful.
I think the paper makes an acceptable for publication.



The paper I reviewed is pretty interesting and attractive. 
I strongly recommend the conference to accept this paper except the author can explain the plagiarism questions below:

There is another paper written by "" who are not related to the paper author I reviewed. 
This paper is called "" which is published at " and could be found at "www"

Both these two papers are 80% similar, in how to organise the paper, the chart, the figure, even the results.
Here some examples are given: (Left is the paper I reviewed, right is the publish paper)
1. A: equations at the page 2            B. Figure at Page 132
2. A: Figure 1 at the page 2             B. Figure 1 at Page 132
3. A: Figure 2 and 3 at Page 3           B: Figure 3. Watermark Recovery at Page 133
4. A: Figure 4 and 5                     B: Figure 4

The examples are exactly the same, they could not be a coincidence. 
Also in the paper I found some equations are images and they are blurred. 
They should not be that way, the author should type the equation. 
So maybe the author make a screen shot from the original paper.
