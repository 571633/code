garbage collection is a system that automatically recycles unused memory in programming languages. 

Pros & cons
The most obvious benefit of having garbage collection is that it makes programming much easier
garbage collection helps developers avoid several memory problems
First, it prevents accessing dangling pointers that point to an object that no longer exists. Secondly, it prevents freeing a region of memory that is already freed (double free). Last, it avoids memory leak


disadvantage is that garbage collection consumes computing resources
developer has the full control over how memory is used, which gives the program much more flexibility and much easier to optimize

the big problem has been simplified to a graph problem â€“ find unreachable nodes in a graph.
The most notable problem is that the entire system must be suspended during garbage collection. In other words, once in a while, the problem will be frozen when doing garbage collection and no mutation of the working set can be allowed. 

Reference counting
Disadvantage of reference counting
If two objects reference each other, they will never be recycled.
