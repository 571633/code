LRU design

Concurrency
The common solution of course is using a lock
split the cache into multiple shards and have a lock for each of them
given that hot entries are more likely to be visited, certain shards will be more often locked than others.

use commit logs. To update the cache, we can store all the mutations into logs rather than update immediately. And then some background processes will execute all the logs asynchronously


Distributed cache
keep a hash table that maps each resource to the corresponding machine
