Suppose you are building a social network product like Twitter, you need to store each user in your database with a user ID, which is unique and used to identify each user in the system.

In some systems, you can just keep incrementing the ID from 1, 2, 3 … N

ID is incremented by date


Single machine
In the simplest case, we can just keep incrementing ID from 1, 2, 3 … N, which in fact is one of the most popular ways to generate ID in many real life projects.

Multiple machine solution
the final ID is a combination of timestamp and the server ID.

We can also allow multiple requests within a single timestamp on a single server. We can keep a counter on each server, which indicates how many IDs have been generated in the current timestamp. 
So the final ID is a combination of timestamp, serverID and the counter.
