machine learning
based on videos a user has watched, we can simply suggest videos from same authors
similar titles or labels
use the popularity (number of comments, shares) as another signal

user-based collaborative filtering
to recommend videos for a user, I can provide videos liked by similar users. For instance, if user A and B have watched a bunch of same videos, it’s highly likely that user A will like videos liked by B. 

Explicit features can be ratings, favorites etc.. In Youtube, it can be the like/share/subscribe actions
Implicit features If a user has watched a video for only a couple of seconds, probably it’s a negative sign
if a user clicks one over another, it can mean that he prefer to the one clicked

Infrastructure
Given that comparing similar users/videos can be time-consuming on Youtube, this part should be done in offline pipelines

similar users/videos are also running regularly in order to keep data updated

For the online part, based on the user profile and his actions (like videos just watched), we should be able to provide a list of recommended videos from offline data.
