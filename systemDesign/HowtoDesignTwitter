Define the problem

Data modeling – If we want to use a relational database like MySQL, we can define user object and feed object. Two relations are also necessary. One is user can follow each other, the other is each feed has a user owner.



Serve feeds – The most straightforward way is to fetch feeds from all the people you follow and render them by time.



1. When users followed a lot of people, fetching and rendering all their feeds can be costly. How to improve this?
each time we only need to fetch the most recent N feeds instead of all of them. 


2. How to detect fake users?
related to machine learning
identify several related features like registration date, the number of followers, the number of feeds etc. and build a machine learning system to detect if a user is fake.



4. How to implement the @ feature and retweet feature?
For @ feature, we can simply store a list of user IDs inside each feed. So when rendering your feeds, you should also include feeds that have your ID in its @ list. 

For retweet feature, we could do the similar thing. Inside each feed, a feed ID (pointer) is stored, which indicates the original post if there’s any.
